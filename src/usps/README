The file format is as follows:

An image is a 16x16 block of grayscale values ranging from 0-255.
Each label/image pair is structured as follows:
<label>
<pixel_1_1>  ... <pixel_1_16>
     .                .
     .                .
     .                .
<pixel_16_1> ... <pixel_16_16>

So, a label/image pair is 17 lines long. First, there is the label in a single line,
then, the 16x16 image is represented in 16 lines with 16 values in each line.
If you view the (unzipped) files with an editor, you can recognize the digits
from the ascii representation, so take a look ;)
